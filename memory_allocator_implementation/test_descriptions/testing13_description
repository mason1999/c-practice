Test 13: Realloc (testing truncating and enlarging)

We test the abillity of the Realloc function to truncate the 
a block and enlarge it. given intial_size = 8 and min_size = 3
we first malloc half the size of initial_size. We then realloc
this to the min_size (thus truncating it). We then finally 
realloc this back to the initial_size of the heap (thus 
enlarging it). We finish by freeing.
