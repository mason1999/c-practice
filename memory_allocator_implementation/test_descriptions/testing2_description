Test 2: Error checking (NULL heapstart) 

This test case will check the case when heapstart is NULL in our five
functions: init_allocator, virtual_malloc, virtual_realloc, virtual_info
and virtual_free. We perform the operations in that order, returning 1 
upon failing virtual_free in main. We print appropriate error messages to
each one.
