Test 8: Free (testing coalescing)

This test case tests the coalescing function of my freeing.
We begin with a heap of size 256 bytes and minimum size block
of 16 bytes. We then malloc 128 bytes, and then malloc the 
smallest granularity (16 bytes). We then free the first 128 
bytes (noting that the coalesing is being stopped by the 
block of size 16 bytes). We then free the block of size 16. 
It will pass if the final block is a block of size 256.
