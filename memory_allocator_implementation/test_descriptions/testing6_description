Test 6: Malloc (mallocing just beneath powers of 2 each time) 

This test case tests the block finding capability of my
virtual_malloc algorithm in finding the smallest power
of two block in the right position. We begin with an intial
size of 512 then call virtual_malloc(255), virtual_malloc(31),
virtual_malloc(33), virtual_malloc(65) and virtual_malloc(1)
while calling the print function after each malloc
