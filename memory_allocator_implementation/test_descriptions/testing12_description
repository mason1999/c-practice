Test 12: Realloc (testing size = 0 and ptr = NULL)

We test the cases when the ptr parameter is NULL (so
this reduces to a malloc) and then we test when the size
parameter is 0 (so this reduces to a free). Since we're 
basically mallocing and freeing (for simplicity we malloc
THEN free the same block), we should arrive back at the original
block we had.
