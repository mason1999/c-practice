Test 10: Realloc (testing reallocing whole heap)

This test case tests realloc twice. The idea behind each realloc
is to coalsce to a section that can then be allocated via
the realloc function. The sequence of functions called here 
(with inital_size = 10, min_size = 6) are:
virtual_malloc(256), virtual_malloc(64), 
virtual_realloc(virtual_heapstart, 256), 
virtual_free(first block) and virtual_free(second block).
