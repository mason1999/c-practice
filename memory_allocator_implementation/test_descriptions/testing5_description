Test 5: Malloc (size too large/no available block found) 

This test case tests virtual_malloc, where there are no available
blocks able to be found. It begins with 2 normal mallocs, but then
tries to malloc a size of just one bigger than the biggest block.
It then tries to malloc a size of the original heap: ultimately
producing two errors.
